## üìã How to Use

1.  **Add Housemates**:
    *   Navigate to the "Household Members" section.
    *   Enter the name of each housemate and click "Add".

2.  **Record Expenses**:
    *   Go to the "Add New Expense" section.
    *   Fill in the expense description, amount, and date.
    *   Select who paid for the expense.
    *   Check the boxes for all housemates who participated in (should share) the expense.
    *   Click "Add Expense".

3.  **View Balances**:
    *   The "Balance Overview" tile will automatically update to show who owes whom.
    *   You can see specific debt amounts (e.g., "Alice owes Bob $10").

4.  **Settle Debts**:
    *   **Individually**: In the "Balance Overview", click "Settle" next to a specific debt to record it as a payment.
    *   **All at Once**: If there are outstanding debts, click "Mark All as Settled" in the "Balance Overview" to record payments for all current debts. This will update the balances accordingly.

5.  **Review History**:
    *   The "Transaction History" tile lists all recorded expenses and settlements.
    *   You can filter transactions by date.
    *   Expenses can be deleted from the history (note: payments made to settle debts cannot be directly deleted this way; they are cleared when history is cleared or by new expenses re-balancing the debts).

6.  **Customize Settings**:
    *   Click the cog (‚öôÔ∏è) icon in the header.
    *   Choose your preferred theme (Light/Dark/System).
    *   Select your desired currency. Settings are saved locally.

## üíæ Data Storage

HowSplit uses your browser's **`localStorage`** to save all application data. This includes:
*   Housemates
*   Expenses
*   Payments
*   Currency preference

**Implications**:
*   **No Account Needed**: Data is stored locally, so no sign-up is required.
*   **Device-Specific**: Data is tied to the browser and device you are using. It won't sync across different devices or browsers.
*   **Persistence**: Data remains available even if you close your browser or shut down your computer, as long as you use the same browser on the same device and don't clear its `localStorage`.
*   **Data Deletion**: Clearing your browser's cache or site data for this application will erase all stored information.
